Function names can be letters, numbers and underscore but the first character cannot me a number. 
Function names cannot be the python's keywords. Avoid to define function and variable with the same name.
Function names are case sensitive.

Single and double quotes are the same in python, double quotes are useful when there is an apostrophe in the string. 
Straight quotes ' ' " " are legal in python
Curly quotes  ‘ ’ “ ” are not. 

When define the function: def function_name(parameter):
When call the function: function_name(argument)
The name of the argument has nothing to do with the name of the parameter. 

Parameters and variables that created in a function are local.
